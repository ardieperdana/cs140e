To set GPIO pin 27 as an output pin and to set/clear it, three registers are required.  The first is one of the FSELx registers, and the others are one of the two SETy and CLEARy registers.

FSEL contains 10 pins per register (three bits per pin), so the 27th register will be stored in GPIO_FSEL2.

SET/CLEAR store 32 pins per register (one bit per pin), so GPIO pin 27 would be in GPIO_SET0 and GPIO_CLR0.
