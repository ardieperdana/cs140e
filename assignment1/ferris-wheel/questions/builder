Implement methods in the builder type so that the unit tests pass:

- default(), which returns an empty builder instance.
- string, which writes the string field and returns self so that it can be used for chaining.
- number, which writes the number field and returns self (similar to string).
- to_string, which returns each value converted to a string, with a space in between them if both exist.

string() was slightly tricky, to accept both a &str and String, it needs to accept an Into<String> which can convert to String from both.
