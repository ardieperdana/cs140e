Starting with the EBPB, get the cluster number of the root directory and start looking in the FAT table at that index.

Calculate the starting point of the FAT with number of reserved sectors * number of bytes per sector, and the starting point of the data section by adding number of fats * sectors per fat * bytes per sector to that.

In the FAT table, read the FAT ID, end-of-cluster-chain marker, and then the ID of the first data cluster assuming it isn't the end-of-cluster-chain marker.

Then, use the data cluster ID and lookup in the data section to find the LFN or regular directory entry.  If it is a LFN, scan over the entries and build up the filename until reaching the directory entry. If it's a directory entry, determine if the name is "a", if not continue to the next data cluster in the FAT table.

If the directory is "a", use the cluster id to determine the start of the subdirectory, and scan it in a similar way looking for subdirectory "b".

Then, after finding the cluster for "b", scan it for a file with name "c.txt" and get the cluster id of that.
