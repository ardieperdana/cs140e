StackVec requires Clone for pop because pop() returns T by-value, and to return by-value T must either implement the Copy or Clone traits.  Without Clone, pop() would need to return a reference, and then it may be possible for the value in StackVec to be overwritten before it is used by the caller.  Pop also changes the len of the StackVec, so to the caller it would appear that they are referencing uninitialized memory.
