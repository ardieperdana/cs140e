StackVec doesn't own its memory, it simply references it, so it requires a lifetime parameter in order to propagate that lifetime guarantee to its callers.  So it accept a lifetime parameter, 'a, and binds T to that lifetime to enforce that the StackVec, or any reference values returned, aren't used after the underlying storage has been deallocated.  If this wasn't done a caller may be able to release the underlying storage while StackVec is still in use.
