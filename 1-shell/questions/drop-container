&mut T should never be returned directly because there is no way to determine when the caller has stopped using the reference.  Rust's safety is based on having only one mutable reference at a time, and if the caller can store the reference there is no way to enforce that.  Wrapping and implementing the Drop trait allows returning the mutable reference to keep the safety guarantee.
