The shell makes use of:
- Console, to handle reading and writing data from the user.
- Uart, to communicate with the hardware for the console.
- Gpio, used during setup of the Uart.
- StackVec, for holding the user's typed characters.
- Volatile to access hardware registers, although a different one versus the one that was written earlier in assignment 1.
