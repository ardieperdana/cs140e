If the scheduler had both a ready queue and a wait queue, I would use the ready queue for normal execution, and when an event that can be waited on occurs, check to see if anything in the waiting queue is unblocked.  If so, then it could be moved to the front of the ready queue.

This way, we don't have to check waiting processes unless we are sure that something has changed, and when an event occurs we can start the thread that's waiting immediately, reducing the overall latency for waiting processes.
