Once we have virtual memory, we can allocate one page worth of virtual memory for the stack by default, and whenever the stack grows beyond the page bounds, a DataAbort will be generated.  When that occurs, we can allocate additional memory for the next portion of the stack and resume execution of the program.

Effectively, the memory doesn't exist until it is accessed.
