Yes, processes have to trust the kernel since it controls everything about the process: it has full access to the memory, execution time, the values of the registers before and after context switches, and that services provided by the kernel follow the contract.

The kernel is used to start the process, allocate memory, and provide system calls (such as accessing the filesystem, sleep).
