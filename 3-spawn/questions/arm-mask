To unmask IRQ interrupts, write to PSTATE.DAIF, specifically the I bit for IRQs.

The easiest way is to use DAIFClr, which allows clearing a specific bit:

3 = D(ebug) - Synchronous (watchpoint, breakpoint, step)
2 = A(bort) - SError
1 = I(RQ)
0 = F(IQ)

msr DAIFClr, #1



=== Additional notes

There is also the DAIF register, which can be used to access the values directly, but it has different offsets:

DAIF has the following bits:
    [31:10] Reserved
    [9] D
    [8] A
    [7] I
    [6] F
    [5:0] Reserved
