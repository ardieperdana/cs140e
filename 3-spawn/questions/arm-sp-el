When the exception occurs, the PSTATE is saved to SPSR_ELx, and the preferred exception link address to ELR_ELx (where x = level that will handle the exception).  Depending on the value of SPSel, A may be saved in SP_ELx.

Assuming that this state is not modified, these values are valid to reuse and return to the previous exception level.

To return the registers to write to depend on the value of SPSel (in the PSTATE).  If SPSel is 0, write to SP_EL0, otherwise write to SP_ELx:

If SPSel == 1:
    msr SP_ELs, B
If SPSel == 0:
    msr SP_EL0, B
