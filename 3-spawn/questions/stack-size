We could implement a kernel call, grow_stack, which would allocate a new block of memory for the larger stack, copy the existing stack into it, and then either remap virtual memory or change SP to point to the new stack location.


The process could execute:

// Request 2 MB of stack
mov x0, #(2 << 20)
sys 1  // Use 1 to indicate "grow_stack"

Then on the rust size, reallocate the stack and compute the new location of TrapFrame::sp with:

let offset = stack.top() - trap_frame.sp;
trap_frame.sp = new_stack.top() - offset;
